## 🧑‍💻 My Contribution

I collaborated with a team to develop the game and took full responsibility for the **Leaderboard Component**:

- Developed a **dynamic leaderboard** that updates in real-time.
- Integrated crown images for the **top three** players.
- Designed a **responsive UI** that scrolls independently of the whole website.
- Focused on clean UI/UX using Tailwind CSS and efficient rendering via React.
